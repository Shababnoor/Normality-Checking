# Normality-Checking

The aim of the codes were to create some random samples from different
distributions and check whether they follow normality or not. Total 28 samples
were generated randomly generated from 7 different distributions where each
distribution had 4 samples. In informal way, histogram, qq-plot, box-plot was
created and in formal way, a Shapiro- Wilk test was conducted in order to check
the normality.
